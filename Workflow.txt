WORKFLOW
-------------

un-setup.R
 --> Creates un_base_workspace.RData

un_base_workspace.RData 
--> Used to run ldatuning Rscripts (WITH CONTROLS AND WITH SPARSITY) from batch_ldatuning directory run on HPC cluster --> Combined together into un_ldatuning_results.RData using combining_tuning.R

--> Used to run single models for select k values (WITH CONTROLS AND WITH SPARSITY) from Rscripts in single_topic_models_with_controls_and_sparsity directory run on HPC cluster --> Combined together into un_models.RData

--> Used to run ldatuning and models (WITHOUT CONTROLS) --> discarded

--> Used to run k_fold_sets_setup.R to set up training/test sets for 10 fold cross validation --> Creates perplexity_k10_base.RData

perplexity_k10_base.RData
--> Used to run scripts to calculate held out perplexity from batch_kfold_perplexity directory --> Combined together using combine_10fold_perplexity_results.R into perplexity_kfold_combined.RData

perplexity_kfold_combined.RData, un_models.RData, un_ldatuning_results.RData
--> Combined together in finalize_k_optimization.R script to produce final workspace
